# DasSpielV1

"DasSpiel" or "Flower Meadow" is a gamified, educational, multiplayer video game that has been created for university students to learn basic concepts of programming. each student controls their own player model - the lawn mower - by calling methods and functions from the provided client-libraries which exist in c, java and python.
the students simultaneously type in their commands from their workstation-pc, in order to control their player model and collect the most points. the playing field is visible to everyone on a big screen.
--> who is the best at automating their lawn mower?

the multiplayer experience is enabled by a tcp-server that has been integrated in unity.
